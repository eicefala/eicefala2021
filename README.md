### EICEFALA is an event promoted by UFMG laboratories from Faculdade de Letras (Laborat√≥rio de Fonologia) and Escola de Engenharia (CEFALA).**

The comprehension of human communication involving speech acoustics and gestures requires knowledge from various fields of science, such as phonetics, phonology, linguistics, acoustics, mechanics, mathematics, physiology, neuroscience and computer science. The objective of the 7th EICEFALA is to present and discuss theoretical and methodological techniques to researchers from the several areas of knowledge working with speech science: linguists, engineers, physicists, speech therapists, musicians, etc. It is expected that the participants of the event find, at EICEFALA, a transdisciplinary forum to address questions related to spoken communication.

 

### In this edition, the meeting's leading theme is: "Advances in speech and L2 processing". 


The topics of the meeting include, but are not restricted to:

- self-organization and complex adaptive systems in the study of speech science;
- physiological, acoustical, and gestural aspects of human communication;
- audiovisual speech analysis;
- methodology and techniques for collecting, archiving and analysis of audio and video data;
- speech acoustics and aerodynamics;
- articulatory movement measurements;
- relations between perception and production mechanisms in spoken communication;
- probabilistic and statistical analysis for speech science;
- experimental research in speech science.
